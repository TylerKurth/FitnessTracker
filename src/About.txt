Inspiration for Project:
    - I invested in my health after college
    - Wanted to create an effective program that others could use to more accurately estimate their Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)


Project Goals: 
    - Refresh C++ skills
    - Develop a more accurate TDEE calculator

What I have learned:
    - Just starting out with a bare-bones project can inspire you to continually refine and improve upon your ideas
